Installing Python:  
* Install [Python 3.3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-335/)
* Install an IDE. You can use [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/), or [Python Tools for Visual Studio](https://pytools.codeplex.com/) or whatever you want.
* Install the [UI modules](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=C2E56DF7676D2B91!17366&authkey=!AMo7AuUoyn3gSmo&ithint=folder%2c.exe): 
 * PyQt
 * PyQwt
 * guidata
 * guiqwt
 * PySDL2

Currently all the code on github is module-independent. ~~I'm going to upload the SDL code (with board graphics) soon, which will require PySDL2.~~ Working from the bottom up. I'll have the Player_Data class complete by tonight, and will then start on AI.py, then finally the board graphics. 

Look at the [TODO](https://github.com/fooziex/cs3420/wiki).
